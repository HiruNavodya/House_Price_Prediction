# House_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset from real estate markets,The ability to predict property prices is increasingly valuable, as it provides insights into market conditions and the economic health of a country.This project utilizes advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve its goals.A comprehensive analysis of the house price prediction dataset from Kaggle was conducted. For the initial phase of the project, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis were performed to understand the type of modeling required during the advanced analysis. In the subsequent phase, various models were developed and evaluated using both R and Python programming languages, with XGBoost identified as the most effective machine learning model for predicting house prices. Challenges such as the presence of outliers and multicollinearity were addressed through appropriate remedies throughout the analysis.
